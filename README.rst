pytask-environment
==================

pytask-environment allows you to detect changes in your pytask environment and abort a
project build.


Installation
------------

Install the plugin with

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda config --add channels conda-forge --add channels pytask
    $ conda install pytask-environment


Usage
-----

If the user attempts to build the project and the Python version has been cached in the
database in a previous run, an invocation with a different environment will produce the
following command line output.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pytask build
    Your Python environment seems to have changed. The Python version has
    changed. The path to the Python executable has changed. Do you want
    to continue with the current environment? [y/N]:


Future development
------------------

The plugin might be further extended to compare the current environment against an
``environment.yml`` or a list of packages and versions to ensure that the environment is
not altered.


Changes
-------

Consult the `release notes <CHANGES.rst>`_ to find out about what is new.
